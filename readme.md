# tg-dom

A bare bones component-style JavaScript framework.

## Install it

Include it directly on your pages:

```html
<script src='https://svidgen.github.io/tg-dom/js/tg-dom.js'></script>
```

## Use it

TODO: write details

* For serverless usage, pulling tpl's over AJAX or from `script` tags
* For a "built" solution, using [build.php](build.php)
* For server-backed solution, like tg-php (coming soon?)
